Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together.





How to implement encapsulation in java:
1) Make the instance variables private so that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. You can only set and get values of these variables through the methods of the class.
2) Have getter and setter methods in the class to set and get the values of the fields.



abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we can create subclasses from it. We can then access members of the abstract class using the object of the subclass.


the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.
